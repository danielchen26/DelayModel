# DelayModel
This repository provides the Julia scripts used to generate numerical examples in the article "Incorporating age and delay into models for biophysical systems" by KhudaBukhsh, Kang, Kenah and Rempa≈Ça. 

We consider an age-structured stochastic Chemical Reaction Network (CRN). Here, we provide Julia scripts to simulate the CRN, calculate a mean first passage time, calculate the large-volume limit of the stochastic system in the form of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We also provide the Julia script for a hybrid simulation algorithm, which approximates a part of the CRN by its large-volume deterministic PDE limit. 

If you have any questions about the Julia scripts, please contact me at khudabukhsh.2@osu.edu.
